Explanations and Notes
Context:  
The repository is ready for V1 on Debian 12, with docker, pcloud, ufw, and jenkins.  

The README is concise, focused on personal needs, with remaining tasks clearly listed.  

No CONTRIBUTING.md or LICENSE is needed, as itâ€™s for personal use only.

README Structure:  
Introduction: Briefly describes the repository.  

Prerequisites: Minimal list for Debian 12.  

Getting Started: Simple instructions to clone, configure, and run.  

Components: Table of playbooks with required validations.  

Tasks Remaining: Precise steps for V1, including commands and code snippets.  

Notes: Reminders for pCloud (Vault) and testing.

Remaining Tasks:  
Removal: Delete dummy.yml.  

Playbook site.yml: Use the corrected version for modular execution.  

Validations: Add checks in each role for idempotence and reliability.  

Molecule: Set up CI/CD tests for docker and pcloud on Debian 12.  

Documentation: Create docs/ for quick reference.  

Inventory: Provide an example for local tests.  

Testing and Tagging: Validate everything on Debian 12 and mark V1.

Debian 12 Focus:  
Roles are compatible with Debian (docker uses the Debian repository).  

Molecule uses the debian:12 image for tests.  

The README specifies Debian 12 to avoid ambiguity.

Validity of site.yml:  
The corrected version (with dashes in roles and vars_files) is syntactically valid.  

Test with --extra-vars or inventory variables to enable roles.

Next Steps
Replace the README:  
Copy the provided content into README.md.  

Update the username and repository URL.

Execute the Tasks:  
Remove dummy.yml.  

Create site.yml, add validations, set up Molecule, and create docs/ and examples/inventory.yml.

Test:  
On Debian 12, run the playbooks and verify services.  

Test Molecule locally for docker and pcloud.

Tag:  
Once validated, tag with git tag v1.0.0.
